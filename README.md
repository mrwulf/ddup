# ddup - Dynamic DNS Health Checker

ddup periodically checks the health of your services and updates the DNS records pointing to healthy deployments.

You can use ddup to configure [round-robin DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_DNS) for load balancing and failover, for internal or external apps, automatically excluding un-healthy replicas.

ddup is **not** a DNS server, instead it works with "dynamic" DNS servers. Currently, it supports these DNS providers:

- Azure DNS
- Cloudflare DNS
- OVH

## Installation

### Using Docker/Podman

You can run ddup as a Docker/Podman container. Container images are available for Linux and support amd64, arm64, and armv7/armhf.

First, create a folder where you will store the configuration file `config.yaml`, for example `$HOME/.ddup`. You can then start ddup with:

```sh
# For podman, replace "docker run" with "podman run"
docker run \
  -d \
  --read-only \
  -v $HOME/.ddup:/etc/ddup:ro \
  ghcr.io/italypaleale/ddup:v0
```

> ddup follows semver for versioning. The command above uses the latest version in the 0.x branch. We do not publish a container image tagged "latest".

### Using Docker Compose

This is an example of a `docker-compose.yaml` for running ddup:

```yaml
version: "3.6"

services:
  ddup:
    image: "ghcr.io/italypaleale/ddup:v0"
    volumes:
      # Set the path on the host OS
      - "/path/to/ddup:/etc/ddup:ro"
    restart: "unless-stopped"
    read_only: true
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
        max-file: "5"
        max-size: "20m"
```

### Start as standalone app

You can download the latest version of ddup from the [Releases](https://github.com/italypaleale/ddup/releases) page. Fetch the correct archive for your system and architecture, then extract the files and copy the `ddup` binary to `/usr/local/bin` or another folder.

Place the configuration for ddup in the `/etc/ddup` folder.

You will need to start ddup as a service using the process manager for your system.

For example, for Linux distributions based on **systemd** you can use the sample unit in [`ddup.service`](./ddup.service): copy this file to `/etc/systemd/system/ddup.service`.

Start the service and enable it at boot with:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable --now ddup
```

## Configuration

ddup requires a configuration file `config.yaml` in one of the following paths:

- `/etc/ddup/config.yaml`
- `$HOME/.ddup/config.yaml`
- Or in the same folder where the ddup binary is located

> You can specify a custom configuration file using the `DDUP_CONFIG` environmental variable.

You can find an example of the configuration file, and a description of every option, in the [`config.sample.yaml`](/config.sample.yaml) file.

## Configuration Options

### Global Settings

- `interval`: How often to perform health checks (e.g., "30s", "1m", "5m")

### Domains and Endpoints

- `webhooks`: Optional webhooks called on events (see `config.sample.yaml`): `url`, `method`, `headers`, `events` (`dns_updated`, `dns_update_failed`, `all_unhealthy`), `body` (Go template; JSON event if omitted; templates can use `.Subject`, `.Text`, `join` and `json`, see the email example), `timeout`, `attempts`. Deliveries are retried with exponential backoff.
- `domains`: Array of domains to manage
  - `recordName`: The DNS record to update (e.g., "api.example.com")
  - `provider`: Name of the DNS provider (from the [`providers` map](#providers-configuration))
  - `ttl`: Time to live for DNS records. A short value is preferred to ensure faster failover from failed deployments. The default value is 120 (seconds, equivalent to 2 minutes)
  - `healthChecks`: Configuration for health checks
    - `timeout`: Request timeout (default: "3s")
    - `attempts`: Maximum number of consecutive attempts before considering the endpoint unhealthy (default: 2)
    - `recoverAfter`: Consecutive successful checks needed before an endpoint that was removed from DNS is added back (default: 1)
    - `method`: `GET` (default) or `HEAD`
    - `expectStatus`: Status code that means healthy: an exact code (like `204`) or `2xx` for any 2xx code. Default: `2xx`. Redirects are not followed
  - `endpoints`: Array of endpoints for this domain
    - `name`: Friendly name for the endpoint, used for logging (optional)
    - `url`: HTTP URL to check for health status
    - `ip`: The IPv4 or IPv6 address to include in DNS records when healthy. IPv4 addresses create A records and IPv6 addresses create AAAA records.
    - `proxied`: If true, the record is proxied by Cloudflare (Cloudflare only). Proxied records use Cloudflare's automatic TTL. All endpoints with the same `priority` must use the same value
    - `priority`: Endpoints with a lower value are preferred (default: 0). See [Failover with priorities](#failover-with-priorities)
    - `host`: Optional hostname to include in the requests, when the request is made to an IP address or to a hostname different from the desired one

### Failover with priorities

By default every healthy endpoint is published (round-robin DNS). Give endpoints a `priority` to use some of them only as a fallback: ddup publishes just the healthy endpoints with the lowest priority value, and when none of those are healthy it publishes the next priority, going back as soon as the preferred ones recover (after `recoverAfter` successful checks, if set). Endpoints that are not published are still health-checked and shown as "standby" in the dashboard.

For example, with two VPS at priority 0 and a proxied fallback address:

```yaml
endpoints:
  - { name: vps-us, url: "https://vps-us.example.com/health", ip: "192.0.2.10" }
  - { name: vps-eu, url: "https://vps-eu.example.com/health", ip: "192.0.2.20" }
  - { name: tunnel, url: "https://tunnel-health.example.com/health", ip: "192.0.2.30", proxied: true, priority: 1 }
```

Both VPS IPs are published while they're healthy, a single IP if only one is, and the proxied fallback address if neither is. If nothing is healthy, ddup leaves DNS unchanged and sends the `all_unhealthy` webhook.

Webhook events include `published`, `tier` and `previousTier`, and dns_updated emails say when the priority changed.

### Providers Configuration

- `providers`: Map of providers.
  - Key: provider name (e.g. `my-provider-1`)
  - Value: an object containing a provider configuration, which is one (and only one) of:
    - [`azure`](#azure-provider-settings)
    - [`cloudflare`](#cloudflare-provider-settings)
    - [`ovh`](#ovh-provider-settings)

#### Azure Provider Settings

Required settings:

- `subscriptionId`: ID of the Azure subscription where the DNS Zone is deployed
- `resourceGroupName`: Name of the Resource Group containing the DNS Zone resource
- `zoneName`: Name of the DNS Zone, which corresponds to the domain name (e.g. `example.com`)

The other settings depend on the authentication method:

- The default authentication method automatically attempts a number of supported methods, including Managed Identity, Workload Identity, Azure CLI credentials (in development), etc. You can also configure it with environmental variables including `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` ([full reference](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azidentity#readme-environment-variables))
- To use a service principal (with client ID and client secret), set these options:
  - `clientId`: Client ID
  - `clientSecret`: Client Secret
  - `tenantId`: Tenant ID
- To use a user-assigned managed identity, set:
  - `managedIdentityClientId`: Client ID of the user-assigned managed identity

Regardless of the authentication method, ensure that the principal (user, service principal, or managed identity) has the **DNS Zone Contributor** role assigned to the DNS zone.

If using a custom RBAC role instead, ensure it includes permissions for both IPv4 and IPv6 DNS records:

```text
Microsoft.Network/dnsZones/A/read
Microsoft.Network/dnsZones/A/write
Microsoft.Network/dnsZones/A/delete
Microsoft.Network/dnsZones/AAAA/read
Microsoft.Network/dnsZones/AAAA/write
Microsoft.Network/dnsZones/AAAA/delete
```

Using the Azure CLI, the built-in **DNS Zone Contributor** role can be assigned with:

```sh
az role assignment create \
  --assignee <client-id> \
  --role "DNS Zone Contributor" \
  --scope "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<rg-name>/providers/Microsoft.Network/dnsZones/<zone-name>"
```

Example:

```yaml
providers:
  example-provider-1:
    azure:
      subscriptionId: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
      resourceGroupName: "my-dns-rg"
      zoneName: "example.com"
```

#### Cloudflare Provider Settings

Required settings:

- `zoneId`: Cloudflare Zone ID for your domain
- `apiToken`: Cloudflare API token with Zone:Edit permissions

To get the credentials:

- API Token: Go to Cloudflare dashboard → My Profile → API Tokens → Create Token
  - Grant `Zone:Edit` permissions for your domain
- Zone ID: Found in the domain overview page

Example:

```yaml
providers:
  example-provider-1:
    cloudflare:
      apiToken: "your-cloudflare-api-token"
      zoneId: "your-zone-id"
```

#### OVH Provider Settings

Required settings:

- `apiKey`: API key
- `apiSecret`: API secret
- `consumerKey`: Consumer key
- `zoneName`: Name of the zone (e.g. `example.com`)

Optional settings:

- `endpoint`: OVH API endpoint, which is one of:
  - `"eu"` (default value if omitted)
  - `"ca"`
  - `"us"`
  - A custom URL

To get the required credentials, navigate to this URL, replacing `{zoneName}` with the name of your zone (e.g. `example.com`):

```text
https://api.ovh.com/createToken/index.cgi?GET=/domain/zone/{zoneName}/*&POST=/domain/zone/{zoneName}/*&DELETE=/domain/zone/{zoneName}/*
```

Example:

```yaml
providers:
  ovh-eu-example:
    ovh:
      apiKey: "your-ovh-api-key"
      apiSecret: "your-ovh-api-secret" 
      consumerKey: "your-ovh-consumer-key"
      zoneName: "example.com"
      endpoint: "eu"
```

### Webhooks

Webhooks are called when something changes (`dns_updated`, `dns_update_failed`, `all_unhealthy`). Each webhook can filter events, set headers, and render its body from a Go template. See `config.sample.yaml` for ntfy, email and generic JSON examples.

#### Email with Resend (or another HTTP email API)

The `email` example in `config.sample.yaml` posts to the [Resend API](https://resend.com/docs/api-reference/emails/send-email) with a bearer API key. Verify your sending domain in Resend, and use an address on it as `from`. Other providers with an HTTP API (Mailgun, Postmark, SendGrid) work the same way: change the URL, auth header and JSON fields.

#### Email with Cloudflare Email Service

The commented-out Cloudflare example in `config.sample.yaml` sends mail through the [Cloudflare Email Service REST API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/api/send-emails/rest-api/) (`POST https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/email/sending/send`). Requirements:

- The account must be entitled to Email Sending, which can require a paid Cloudflare plan (the API answers with code 10105 otherwise).
- Onboard the sender domain in the Cloudflare dashboard (Compute → Email Service → Email Sending → Onboard Domain). Cloudflare adds MX, SPF, DKIM and DMARC records on the `cf-bounce` subdomain, which takes about 5-15 minutes. The domain must be onboarded on the same account that owns the API token, and `from` must be an address on it.
- API token: create a custom token with the **Account → Email Sending → Edit** permission, with the account that owns the domain under Account Resources. Cloudflare's docs name this permission "Email Sending: Edit". It needs nothing else.
- Use a token separate from the DNS token used by the `cloudflare` provider (which needs **Zone → DNS → Edit**), so that each token can do only one thing.
- Replace `your-account-id` in the URL with your [account ID](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/account/find-account-and-zone-ids/).

If the API answers 403 with code 10102, the token lacks the permission. Code 10105 means the account isn't entitled to Email Sending, and 10203 means sending is disabled for the zone or account.

### Server Settings

- `enabled`: Enable the server (disabled by default)
- `bind`: Address to bind to (defaults to `127.0.0.1`)
- `port`: Port to listen on (defaults to `7401`)

The server has no authentication, so keep it on a trusted network. It exposes:

- `GET /api/status` and `GET /api/status/{recordname}`: current status of the domains
- `POST /api/check`: runs health checks for all domains right away (the dashboard's "Check now" button), and returns the updated status. The request must include the header `X-Requested-By: ddup-dashboard`, which keeps other websites from triggering it through a visitor's browser. If a check finished less than 5 seconds ago, no new one is run. A forced check counts towards `attempts` and `recoverAfter` like a scheduled one, and the next scheduled check is then a full `interval` later
- `GET /healthz`: returns 204 when the server is up

### Logging Settings

- `log`: Logging options
  - `level`: Controls log level and verbosity. Supported values: `debug`, `info` (default), `warn`, `error`.
  - `json`: If true, emits logs formatted as JSON, otherwise uses a text-based structured log format. Defaults to false if a TTY is attached (e.g. when running the binary directly in the terminal or in development); true otherwise.
